## SECTION 2 : EXECUTIVE SUMMARY / PAPER ABSTRACT
---
The financial stock market is very important in the modern day world. It helps countries, institutional and retail investors in capital formation. Therefore, the skills or tools to better understand the stock market are relevant and highly sought after. 

Understanding human decision-making in stock investment is pivotal for maximizing profits in the stock market. Sentiment analysis is one of many tools that an investor can apply in their trading strategy to attempt to gain foresight into future price movements (Deveikyte et al., 2022)1. This project aims to utilize financial sentiment analysis on news sourced from traditional and social media platforms, coupled with historical stock price movements, to design a model to provide investors/traders a prediction of the future stock price movements based on the most recent news.

The team believes this project can provide investors, institutional or retail alike, valuable insights into the market sentiment trends, enabling more informed decision-making in their market investments/trades and potentially higher returns on investment.

The team has designed a full system architecture using a domain-specific knowledge discovery via big data mining techniques like API pull. The data then goes through further knowledge refinement to form the knowledge base. Then, the knowledge base is fed into the cognitive systems like natural language processing (NLP) models to gain insights. The insights are then fed for machine learning techniques with another set of knowledge base to produce an output of financial sentiment and estimated price movement for a particular stock requested by the user.  Due to the wide range of natural language models and machine learning techniques available, performance testing was carried out to give the highest performance score for a combination of natural language model and machine learning technique. Through the performance testing, the team has developed a combination of the financial NLP model distilroberta and hypertuned random forest classification with an accuracy score of 0.91 and f1 score of 0.76.
